# PokiBooks
![code coverage badge](https://github.com/pat955/poki_books/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

This is PokiBooks, a simple and clean ebook reader. Read books from txt files, keep notes for each book, aswell as customize layout, appearance and font size.

## Why?
I made this reader because I love reading but I didn't have a reader app I really liked for books available in the public domain.
Originally this started as a count words in a text file project, however i kept building on it until it became something i actually use!
